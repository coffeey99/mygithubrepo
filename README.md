# Learning Projects – IT Specialist Training

I am currently retraining as an **IT Specialist (Fachinformatiker Systemintegration)**.

In this repository, I document some of my **learning projects and exercises** as part of my training.

I am still a **beginner**, so please excuse any mistakes — I am learning step by step 😊  
This repository is also part of my journey to **get familiar with Git and GitHub**.

## Purpose of this repository
- Document learning progress
- Practice Git and GitHub
- Collect small projects and experiments
- Learn by doing

## Notes
- The projects here are mainly for **learning purposes**
- Things may change, break, or improve over time
- Feedback is welcome

Thanks for taking a look!
